### Project Description
[ComplaintHub is a web application that allows students to submit complaints online and track their status. Administrators can view, manage, and update complaints as Pending, In Progress, Resolved, or Rejected. The system helps organize issues efficiently and improves communication between students and administration.]

### The Problem statement
[This project intents to solve the problem of unorganized and delayed complaint handling in colleges. Usually, complaints are given verbally or on paper, which can be lost, ignored, or not tracked properly. Our system provides a structured digital platform where complaints are recorded, monitored, and updated transparently, ensuring accountability and faster resolution.]

### The Solution
[we are solving it by creating ComplaintHub, a web platform where students can submit complaints with details and track their status in real time. Managers can view, filter, prioritize, and update all complaints from a single dashboard. It replaces scattered paper forms and emails with a centralized, traceable system that highlights urgent and long-pending issues for better transparency and faster resolution.]
